# Brainstorming Notes

## Based on "Don't Say Um":
- Stop fillers: um, uh, like, you know
- Control pacing: slow down speech
- Use pause as power
- Project confidence and resonance

## Drill Ideas:
- Repeat-after-me scripts
- Breath control timers
- Random pause insertions
- "Say This Slower" cards
- Awareness-focused coaching, not censorship

## Feature Enhancements:
- Audio timeline with filler-word markers
- Toggle between fast and slow playback
- Compare 2 takes (A/B recording tool)
